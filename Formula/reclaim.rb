# Homebrew formula for reclaim.
#
# This is the file that gets copied into the tap repository
# (github.com/gokul-kulkarni/homebrew-tap) as Formula/reclaim.rb.
# ./scripts/update-tap.sh rewrites the version and the four sha256 values and
# pushes it there once all four platform tarballs exist on a GitHub release
# (two built by CI, two attached locally by ./scripts/release-macos.sh — see
# docs/releasing.md).
#
# It installs a prebuilt binary rather than building from source: reclaim
# embeds a Vite frontend, so a source build would need both Rust and Node as
# build dependencies for no benefit to the user.
#
# Test it locally before publishing with ./scripts/brew-test.sh — that builds a
# tarball from your working tree and installs it through brew for real.

    <<~EOS
      Run `reclaim` for the interactive terminal UI, or `reclaim ui` for the web UI.

      By default only well-known global caches are scanned. To also find
      node_modules, target/ and .venv inside your projects, tell reclaim where
      your code lives:

        reclaim config init
        # then set project_roots in ~/.config/reclaim/config.toml

      Nothing is ever deleted without your confirmation, and `reclaim scan`
      never deletes anything at all.
